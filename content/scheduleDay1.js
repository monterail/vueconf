These are the well-known extremes, but for many apps and teams, a lesser-known shade in between would be a better fit.\n\n In this talk, we’ll explore the entire spectrum of integration strategies, including varieties at the extremes. For every kind of app, you’ll learn what’s worked for others and what’s held them back, including specific code examples you can adapt for your own apps.",

But with a new generation of websites—single page applications—come a new set of challenges for users with disabilities, and the assistive technology they use to browse the web. Client-side routing, custom input elements, and shiny animated content: all things that screen readers can struggle with if the developer who implemented it didn't consider accessibility.\n\n During this talk, I'll explain what we as developers can do to ensure that our single page applications are usable by everyone, including people who might not use a keyboard, mouse and screen like the majority of us do. I'll show how some assistive technology is used, and demonstrate how some common mistakes we make affect people using that assistive technology.",

We will understand when and how to integrate Firebase with Vue to create real time applications.",

We’ll continue to test some simple Vue Components and see how we can effectively test and store the rendered output with snapshots.\n\n Well conclude by looking at a component that heavily relies on Vuex for it’s state management and peek into the possible directions from there.",
