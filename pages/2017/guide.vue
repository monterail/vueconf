          h2: strong The location
          p.
            It was one of the most important criteria for picking the venue  – just next to the city centre and old town. This means it’s a perfect opportunity for all the attendees to explore Wrocław, one of the most beautiful cities in Poland.
          p.
            Secondly, there are multiple hotels and hostels nearby, meaning no need to use the public transportation to reach the venue and back, as well as tons of restaurants and pubs to go after the conference.

      h2: strong Why Wrocław?
      p.
        We chose Wroclaw as the venue for VueConf because the city has a well-developed IT sector - the best in Poland. Due to its uniqueness, it became the European Capital of Culture in 2016. Wroclaw itself is a magical, picturesque place with a long history and has about 100 bridges.
      p.
        To break the hard set schedule, plan a few extra days after the conference and explore the city, visit various nightclubs and taste Polish cuisine - there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. There are also many options for walking tours: search for famous dwarves (small figures spread around the city), follow fantastic murals or taste a diverse array of beer brands. Meet Wroclaw before you leave!
